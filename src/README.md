## Space Invaders for PICO-8

#### TODO
- make enemies faster when they die
- make enemies move toward the player when they die
- enemy range should increase as columns are eliminated
- repopulate enemies when they are killed
- extra lives?
- add new enemies
- add barriers
- enemy speed increase needs to be mix of distance traveled
  and update_rate
- better code re-use for sprite updating frequency
- try increasing speed after each wave? rather than during a wave?
